* Automation API Deep Dive

** What Makes It Unique

*** Programmatic Infrastructure
#+begin_src python
# Traditional: CLI-driven
# pulumi up

# Automation API: Programmatic
stack = auto.create_or_select_stack(
    stack_name="production",
    program=lambda: create_infrastructure(config)
)
result = await stack.up()
#+end_src

*** Inline Programs
#+begin_src python
def create_infrastructure():
    # Define infrastructure directly in code
    bucket = aws.s3.Bucket("my-bucket")
    return {"bucket_name": bucket.bucket}

# No separate Pulumi project required
stack = auto.create_stack(
    stack_name="dev",
    program=create_infrastructure
)
#+end_src

*** Advanced Use Cases
