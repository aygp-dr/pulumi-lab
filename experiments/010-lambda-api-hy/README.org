#+AUTHOR: aygp-dr
#+DATE: 2025-08-20

* Overview

Creates a serverless API using AWS Lambda and API Gateway, written in Hy.

* Architecture

- API Gateway REST API
- Lambda function handler
- CloudWatch logging
- IAM roles and policies

* Prerequisites

- Pulumi CLI 3.145.0+
- Python 3.11+ with Hy 1.0.0+
- AWS credentials or LocalStack

* Testing Locally

#+begin_src bash
# With LocalStack
export AWS_ENDPOINT_URL=http://localhost:4566

# Deploy
pulumi up

# Test endpoint
curl $(pulumi stack output api_url)
#+end_src

* Cross-Platform Notes

- Works on FreeBSD with Pulumi Linux compatibility
- LocalStack requires Docker (use AWS free tier as alternative)
- Lambda deployment packages work across platforms
